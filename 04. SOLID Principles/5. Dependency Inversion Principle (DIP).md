# DIP

<br>

### Definition
The **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** says:
- `Depend on abstractions, not on concrete classes.`
> 1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes).
> 2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.

---

### Key Idea
- `Don’t hard-code dependencies` on concrete classes.
- Use `interfaces or abstract classes`, so you can swap implementations without changing your main logic.
- This leads to `loose coupling, flexibility, and testability`.
- `Dependency Injection (DI)` is a common and practical way to implement DIP. It involves `passing dependencies` (typically via constructor injection) rather than instantiating them directly.

---

### When to Use DIP
- When a class depends on another class to do some work `(e.g., service → repository, controller → service)`.
- When you want your code to be `easily testable`, `Flexible (change implementations easily)`, reusable and extendable.
- You’re working on `large or complex systems`. Loose coupling helps manage complexity and makes collaboration easier in teams.

---

### When Not to Use DIP
- For `very small or simple scripts` where adding interfaces may be overkill.
- When you’re not expecting multiple implementations or not writing reusable/testable code.
- During `rapid prototyping` or `one-time tasks` — keep it simple first, refactor later.

## Real-Life Examples of DIP (with Explanations)

## 1. Message Logger System

- **High-level module:** Application that needs to log events.  
- **Low-level module:** Console logger, file logger, cloud logger.  
- **Abstraction:** `Logger` interface (e.g., `log(String message)`).  
- **DIP in action:** The application depends on the `Logger` interface, not on how/where the logging happens. Log destinations can be swapped easily.

## 2. Payment Processing System

- **High-level module:** Checkout or `PaymentService`.  
- **Low-level module:** Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay, etc.  
- **Abstraction:** `PaymentGateway` interface.  
- **DIP in action:** Business logic calls `PaymentGateway.pay()`. Stripe or PayPal implementations can be injected dynamically.

## 3. Notifications System

- **High-level module:** `NotificationService`.  
- **Low-level module:** Email, SMS, Push Notification.  
- **Abstraction:** `Notifier` interface.  
- **DIP in action:** The system sends notifications through a generic interface. Switching from email to SMS doesn’t require changes to the service logic.

## 4. Music Player System

- **High-level module:** `MusicController` (play, pause, next).  
- **Low-level module:** MP3, WAV, FLAC decoders.  
- **Abstraction:** `AudioDecoder` interface.  
- **DIP in action:** The music player uses the `AudioDecoder` interface to play files, so adding a new format doesn’t affect controller logic.

## 5. Data Storage

- **High-level module:** `DataPersistenceService`.  
- **Low-level module:** SQL DB, NoSQL DB, file storage.  
- **Abstraction:** `DataStore` interface (`save()`, `load()`).  
- **DIP in action:** The system doesn't care if data goes to MongoDB or flat files—it depends on a generic interface.

## 6. Vehicle Maintenance System

- **High-level module:** `MaintenanceScheduler`.  
- **Low-level module:** `EngineCheckService`, `OilChangeService`, etc.  
- **Abstraction:** `MaintenanceTask` interface.  
- **DIP in action:** The scheduler triggers tasks through an interface. You can add new maintenance tasks without touching the scheduler.

## 7. User Authentication

- **High-level module:** `AuthService`.  
- **Low-level module:** OAuth2, JWT, LDAP, Social login.  
- **Abstraction:** `AuthProvider` interface.  
- **DIP in action:** The app depends on `AuthProvider.authenticate()`, and any auth mechanism can be injected.

## Example - Payment Processing System

### Violates DIP

```JAVA

public class Bkash {
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Bkash payment is " + amount);
    }
}

public class Nagad {
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Nagad pay is " + amount);
    }
}

public class PaymentProcessor {
    private Bkash bkash = new Bkash();
    private Nagad nagad = new Nagad();

    public void processPayment(String system, double amount) {
        if (system.equals("nagad")) {
            nagad.pay(amount);
        } else if (system.equals("bkash")) {
            bkash.pay(amount);
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("Invalid system: " + system);
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello");

        PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor();
        paymentProcessor.processPayment("bkash", 200);
    }
}


```

### Maintains DIP

```JAVA

public interface PaymentSystem {
    public void pay(double amount);
}

public class Bkash implements PaymentSystem {
    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Bkash payment is " + amount);
    }
}

public class Nagad implements PaymentSystem {
    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Nagad payment is " + amount);
    }
}

public class Rocket implements PaymentSystem {
    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Rocket payment is " + amount);
    }
}

public class PaymentProcessor {
    private PaymentSystem paymentSystem;

    public PaymentProcessor(PaymentSystem paymentSystem) {
        this.paymentSystem = paymentSystem;
    }

    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        paymentSystem.pay(amount);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello");

        PaymentSystem paymentSystem = new Rocket();

        PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor(paymentSystem);

        paymentProcessor.processPayment(200);
    }
}

```
