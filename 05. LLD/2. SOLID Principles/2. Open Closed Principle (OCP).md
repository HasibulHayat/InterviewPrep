# Open Closed Principle (OCP)


### Definition
The `Open-Closed Principle (OCP)` states that software entities should be `open for extension` but `closed for modification`. This means new functionality, such as adding a new notification type, can be introduced without altering existing code.
<br><br>

### Real-World Example
Imagine a messaging app that sends notifications via email, SMS, or WhatsApp. Initially, it supports these channels, but later, you need to add Telegram or Slack notifications. Without OCP, you’d modify the core sending logic for each new type, risking errors. With OCP, you extend the system by adding new classes (e.g., `TelegramNotification`) that implement the `Notification` interface, leaving the original sender unchanged, much like plugging in a new device to a USB port without rewiring the computer.
<br><br>

### Before Applying OCP
Before applying OCP, the notification system used an enum with conditional logic, requiring changes to both the enum and sender for new types, violating OCP.
<br><br>


```java

import java.util.List;

public enum NotificationType {
    EMAIL, SMS, WHATSAPP;

    public void sendSMSNotification() {
        System.out.println("Sending SMS ... ");
    }

    public void sendEmailNotification() {
        System.out.println("Sending EMAIL ... ");
    }

    public void sendWhatsAppNotification() {
        System.out.println("Sending Whatsapp message ... ");
    }
}


class NotificationSender {
    public void sendNotification(List<NotificationType> notificationTypes) {
        for (NotificationType type : notificationTypes) {
            if (type == NotificationType.SMS) {
                type.sendSMSNotification();
            } else if (type == NotificationType.EMAIL) {
                type.sendEmailNotification();
            } else if (type == NotificationType.WHATSAPP) {
                type.sendWhatsAppNotification();
            }
        }
    }
}


class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<NotificationType> types = List.of(
            NotificationType.EMAIL,
            NotificationType.SMS,
            NotificationType.WHATSAPP
    );

        NotificationSender sender = new NotificationSender();
        sender.sendNotification(types);

    }
}

```
<br>


## Issues
- **OCP Violation**: Adding a new type (e.g., `TELEGRAM`) requires:
  - Modifying `NotificationType` to add `TELEGRAM` and a `sendTelegramNotification` method.
  - Updating `NotificationSender` with a new `else if` branch.
- **Tight Coupling**: `NotificationSender` depends on specific enum constants and methods.
- **Poor Encapsulation**: Each type has access to all methods (e.g., `EMAIL` can call `sendSMSNotification`), risking misuse.
- **Scalability**: The `if-else` chain grows with each new type, increasing complexity.
<br><br>


### After Applying OCP
Your refactored system uses an interface `Notification` and concrete classes (`EmailNotification`, `SmsNotification`, `WhatsappNotification`). `NotificationSender` processes any `Notification` implementation, allowing new types without modification.
<br><br>

```java

import java.util.List;

public interface Notification {
    void send();
}


public class EmailNotification implements Notification {
    @Override
    public void send() {
        System.out.println("Sending EMAIL ... ");
    }
}


public class SmsNotification implements Notification {
    @Override
    public void send() {
        System.out.println("Sending SMS ... ");
    }
}


public class WhatsappNotification implements Notification {
    @Override
    public void send() {
        System.out.println("Sending Whatsapp message ... ");
    }
}


public class NotificationSender {
    public void sendNotification(List<Notification> notifications) {
        for (Notification notification : notifications) {
            notification.send();
        }
    }
}


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("\nHello and Welcome to Open Closed Principle! \n");

        List<Notification> notifications = List.of(
            new EmailNotification(),
            new SmsNotification(),
            new WhatsappNotification()
        );

        NotificationSender sender = new NotificationSender();
        sender.sendNotification(notifications);

    }
}
```
<br><br>


## How It’s Improved
- **OCP Compliance**: To add a new type (e.g., `TelegramNotification`):
  ```java
  public class TelegramNotification implements Notification {
      @Override
      public void send() {
          System.out.println("Sending Telegram message ... ");
      }
  }
  ```
  Simply include it in the list:
  <br>
  ```java
  List<Notification> notifications = List.of(new TelegramNotification());
  ```
  No changes to `NotificationSender` or existing classes are needed.
- **Polymorphism**: The `send` method ensures each type handles its own logic, eliminating conditionals.
- **Encapsulation**: Each class defines only its behavior, preventing misuse.
- **Flexibility**: New types can be added as classes, supporting dynamic or external integrations.
<br><br>

### Benefits
- **Extensibility**: New notification types (e.g., Slack, Push) can be added without modifying `NotificationSender`, reducing bugs.
- **Maintainability**: No `if-else` logic, making the code cleaner and easier to update.
- **Testability**: Interface-based design allows mocking `Notification` for unit tests.
- **Scalability**: Supports growing systems, as new classes can integrate with frameworks or external services.
- **Decoupling**: `NotificationSender` depends only on the `Notification` interface, not specific implementations.
<br> <br>

### When Not to Use the Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

- **Simple Systems with No Expected Changes** : If the system is small and unlikely to require new functionality (e.g., a one-off notification system that only sends emails and will never support SMS or push notifications), applying OCP adds unnecessary complexity.  
  *Example*: A script sending email alerts for a personal project doesn’t need an interface for future extensibility.

- **Early Development or Prototyping** : In the initial stages of a project or during prototyping, requirements may be unclear. Over-engineering with OCP (e.g., creating a `Notification` interface before knowing if SMS or push notifications will be needed) can slow down development.  
  *Example*: A startup building an MVP might hardcode email notifications to ship faster.

- **Performance-Critical Systems** : In performance-sensitive applications (e.g., real-time notification systems), the overhead of polymorphism (virtual method calls, interface dispatching) introduced by OCP might be undesirable, especially if the system is stable and unlikely to change.  
  *Example*: A high-frequency trading system sending alerts might prioritize speed over extensibility.

- **Limited Resources or Tight Deadlines** : If time or team expertise is constrained, implementing OCP might not be feasible. A simpler, tightly coupled solution (e.g., a single `NotificationService` class handling email and SMS) may be prioritized to meet deadlines.  
  *Example*: A small team building a notification feature for a hackathon might skip OCP to focus on functionality.

- **Overhead Outweighs Benefits** : If the cost of designing for extensibility (e.g., creating interfaces, abstract classes) is high compared to the likelihood of needing new features, OCP may not be justified.
<br> <br>

### Summary
The Open-Closed Principle ensures your notification system can evolve without altering existing code. The original enum-based system violated OCP, requiring modifications for new types. Your interface-based design, using `Notification`, `EmailNotification`, `SmsNotification`, `WhatsappNotification`, and `NotificationSender`, allows new types to be added by creating classes that implement `Notification`. The `Main` class demonstrates this by sending notifications polymorphically, producing clear output. This design is robust, flexible, and aligned with OCP, making it ideal for systems expecting future growth.
